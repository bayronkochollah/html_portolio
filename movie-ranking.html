<h1>BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME ACCORDING TO BAYRON</h1>
<h2>My Top Ten Movies List</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Tenet</h3>
<p>Yes it is defiitely a Christopher Nolan Film. The mind fuckery that goes on in here is amazing. I love the waya I had to watch it twice to fully comprehend it. I dont want to spol it for you but if you love scifi and out there creative directions this is definitely for you. it has an epic plot and was magnificently executed.</p>
<h3>Black Mirror</h3>
<p> Okay before you come for my head i acknowledge that this is a series rather than a film. BUt it has the most thought provoking episodes. Currently in its fifth season, this series will make you question reality leaving you with a lot of what ifs. its a dystopic series in that most of the episodes are a reflection of the writers' dystopias. I also love it because every episode is standalone, so you dont have to watch it in order you can just pick a random episode nd have fun. favourite episode is San Junipero and when you watch it youll understand why.</p>
<h3>Avengers Infinity War</h3>
<p>I am a marvel stan as you can tell although I am not that deep into it. Tbvh its never that serious. but this is one of their best works simply because they went out of their way to redefine everything. this single movie has so many redefining moments for the MCU I cannot even begin to explain my fascintion with it. The thoughts were definitely well executed and if you love super hero stuff you will definitely be glued to your screen all through the movie.</p>
<h3>The Boys</h3>
<p>If you are a guy you want a guy group like this. The strong willed leader who is always getting you into shitty situations because of their sense of justice, the level headed one who is always trying to maintain peace and make the plans work because he is more rational than the rest of you, the connections guy who seems to know how to get the weirdest shit you will need in executing the plan, and lastly the newbie who is there for the plot and who most definitely needs saving but is always pushing past his limits to help the team. it is definitely a great watch and yes it is also a series. It is not a conventional superhero movie and portrays a much darker side of super heroes which serves to make the plot even more spicier. I definitely dare you to watch this.</p>
